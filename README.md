## Tutorial for Using the ARK Game Save Management Program


### 1. Setting the Game Directory
- **Click** “**Select Game Directory**” to choose the ARK game directory:
   - Select the main ARK directory, such as `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\ARK`.
   - **Note**: If the program cannot find the “Saved” folder, you’ll see an error message.

### 2. Setting the Save Directory
- **Click** “**Select Save Directory**” to set the directory where game saves will be stored:
   - Choose any location on your computer. The program will create a “Saves” folder with three subfolders: “Save 1,” “Save 2,” and “Save 3.”
   - These subfolders serve as slots for different saved game states.

### 3. Saving the Game
1. **Click** “**Save Game**” to back up the current game state.
2. A dialog box will ask you to select a save slot – type “1,” “2,” or “3”:
   - **1**: Saves the game in “Save 1.”
   - **2**: Saves the game in “Save 2.”
   - **3**: Saves the game in “Save 3.”
3. The program will display a progress bar while copying the files.
4. Once completed, a confirmation message will appear.

### 4. Loading a Saved Game
1. **Click** “**Load Game**” to restore a previously saved game.
2. Enter the save slot you wish to load in the dialog box (1, 2, or 3).
3. The program will copy files from the selected save slot into the game directory. During this process, a progress bar will appear.
4. When loading is finished, a confirmation message will notify you of success.
